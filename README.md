# Test-201

In this test, you will create a backend server for our frontend Movie data app.

### Need to look over the edit.js, input.js, and index.js for the routes urls and the data we are expecting to get from the backend.

# Instructions:

1. Fork this repo then clone the forked repo
2. In this app, you can create a movie, get all movies, get one movie to edit, edit a movie, and delete a movie.
3. To test, drag index.html to browser and you can click around and test.

# Hints:

- Don't need to give the data a key for the json response
- Use console.log to help you see what data you're getting (in browser and terminal)
- Remember that you need the backend running!
- You can also test your routes using Postman.
- If you have any further questions, please slack Mike or Ginny.
